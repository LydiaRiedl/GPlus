%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% 1stLevel Script for G+ Data %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% FOR ANALYSIS WITH SPM %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% by Lydia Riedl %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% runs on server 28.01.2020 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%% summary
% This script performs 1st level analysis (specification + estimation)
... of a single subject using the SPM12 jobman utilities. Specifically, 
... it creates an SPM.mat file containing all parameters for 1st level.
... Data where preprocessed with fMRIPrep
... and are provided in BIDS standardized format.

%% references

...please check https://bids.neuroimaging.io/

...please check https://fmriprep.readthedocs.io

...please check https://osf.io/uh4f9/

%% CAVE
% it is important to always run analyses on the same server and with the 
...same matlab/spm version earlier subjects were run with!!

% server: mri008
%
% matlab: MATLAB 9.2.0 (R2017a)
%
% spm: SPM12 - started by typing 'spm12' in terminal (on server, SPM12 does
... not start automatically!

%% Inputs
%       subj     : subject ID       In G+ project, the subjects'directories 
%                                   are in BIDS format and named according 
%                                   to BIDS standards with 's' being the 
%                                   patient group and 'g' being the control 
%                                   group.
%       assess   : assessments      According to BIDS standards, the
%                                   structural measurement's directory is 
%                                   named 'anat' and the functional 
%                                   measurement's directory is named
%                                   'func'.
%       dir_path : directory path   directory with preprocessed EPIs
%       logfile_path: logfile path  directory with the output files with
%                                   the stimulus onset times and durations
%                                   grouped after stimulus condition
%       tgt_path : target directory ...for newly written SPM-mat files
%       jobfile  : jobfile          path, where the SPM-jobfile is stored
%                                   and name of the correct jobfile
