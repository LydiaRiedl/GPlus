# Gplus
Abbreviation for the project: G+

ABOUT THE PROJECT:
Schizophrenia is one of the most frequent mental with symptoms like hallucinations and ego-disturbances, affecting approximately 1% of the population. In many cases these so-called positive symptoms can be successfully treated by medication. Moreover there are severe thought and language impairments manifesting in communicative dysfunctions and therefore in social isolation that cannot be treated medically. One of the underlying communicative dysfunctions in patients with schizophrenia is the inability to integrate gestural information: Patients tend to misinterpret information from two modalities (auditory and visually). Several previous studies have shown reduced skills especially in interpreting gesture accompanying figurative speech.
With the G+ project we have established a standardised eight-hour training programme, training gesture skills. We investigate the neural plasticity effects of the training on social-cognitive abilities in patients with schizophrenia. Throughout the programme, we use perceptual tasks as well as gesture production to improve the patientâ€™s integration skills. Furthermore, we focus on cognitive aspects of gesture to facilitate social-cognitive functioning in everyday life. We also offer information about gesture and its benefits for communication. With the help of functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and behavioral measures, we seek to investigate the implications for future therapy, in order to improve treatment methods for patients with schizophrenia.

ABOUT THE CODE:
Here I provide my MATLAB scripts used for GLM analysis of functional brain imaging data using Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM: https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/).
The scripts containing "1stlevel" in the name run single subject analyses. 
The scripts containing "2ndlevel" in the name run group level analyses.

HOW TO USE THESE SCRIPTS: 
The scripts ending with "loop.m" are meant to be run. The "loop" files will automatically call the job files that are associated (assuming the scripts are stored in the same directory and are added to the matlab path).
